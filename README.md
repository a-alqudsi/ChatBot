This is an ongoing chatbot project, designed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which exhibits my skills in web development, event handling, DOM manipulation, and asynchronous JavaScript. The project currently presents a
user-friendly UI, responsive layout, and interactive animations, although its response mechanism to user inputs is still under development. At present, it supports a limited set of commands and occasionally
may not function as expected. However, I am actively working on refining its interactive capabilities and incorporating more complex dialogues.
